# ABM Sustainability ASB591 Demo Git Repository

## Initial workflow
Some rough guidelines for using Git in a single repository setup (i.e., no forking / pull requests, all collaborators
have write access to the same central repository).

1. Pull before committing changes
2. Resolve conflicts if any
3. Try to keep changes small and group them into logical commits. If you added data files, or updated documentation make each of those a separate commit from changes to the NetLogo code. The one exception to this might be if you made changes to the code that logically correspond to changes in some input data files and you want to keep these logically grouped together.
4. Write descriptive log messages to remind yourself and summarize what changes you made to your teammates
5. Push your changes
